# Cross-Lingual-Document-Translator
This project implements a document translator which can translate English to Dutch and vice-versa. Statistical Machine Translation model has been used. IBM model and EM algorithm have been implemented from scratch

## Aim
Aim of this project is to implement a cross lingual document translator from scratch without using NLTK, etc python libraries. 

## Directory structure
```bash
.
├── Design Document.pdf
├── IR_Final_Notebook.ipynb
├── Interface.py
└── README.md
```
- [IR_Final_Notebook.ipynb](IR_Final_Notebook.ipynb) contains the code for the model used for document translation
- [Interface.py](Interface.py) contains the code which implements the interface that the user interacts with

## Tech used
- python3
- jupyterlab (This would be used to generate the dictionary which maps English and Dutch words after running the model on the corpus)
